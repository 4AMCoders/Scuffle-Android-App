This is the documentation for Scuffle Android App by Henry H. and Kevin L.

Abstraction of Scuffle
--------------------------

Scuffle is 1-player, turn-based card game involving basic strategy and a small degree of randomness. The basis for Scuffle is taken from the five-elements theory. There are currently 5 card types that interact according to the relational diagram of the five-elements theory. On top of these relationships, a special system is implemented to allow the player to perform trade-off actions to control the flow of the game. The current state of the game is not final.
